        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          In ordinary discourse, a linguist is a person who has mastered many languages, and linguists quickly get used to being asked how many languages they can speak. But in academia, linguists study languages not because they wish to speak them fluently, but because they wish to understand the nature of Language in general.

          At Washington University, Linguistics is a special interdepartmental program that primarily serves undergraduates. Students may major or minor in Linguistics, and many of our courses can be used to fulfil cluster requirements. The Courses page includes courses taught by other departments which increase understanding of linguistics and can, in most cases, also be applied toward a Linguistics major or minor.      </p>

  <p>
I'm the type of person that loves involving myself in experiences and activities around me.
<br />
<br />
One day I know that I want to start a company, and I will be the first to admit that I don't have the idea yet.
<br />
<br />
I'm constantly paying attention to inefficiencies in society and thinking about ways to improve them. But more than that, I am focused on continuing to grow personally, socially, and mentally so that when I get the idea that I know I will get at some point, I will have the skills, energy and network to run with it.
<br /><br />
So to continue to grow I have gotten involved with many different organizations. I am definitely very busy, but I enjoy everything I do which gives me the energy to take it all head on.

<h2>Q&A With Me</h2>

<h3>
Question 1: Why did you choose Wash U for college?
</h3>

<p>
  I had heard of Wash U because my mom grew up in St. Louis and my grandparents attended school here. When applying to college, I had the test scores to put me in contension at a school like Wash U, but my grades were a little low for what was expected. So I applied to a lot of competitive schools, hoping one would take me. Wash U was the only one that did take me, and it ended up working out perfectly. Couldn't be happier here.
</p>
<h3>
Question 2: What is one of your favorite quotes?
</h3>
<p>
  "You laugh at me because I'm different, I laugh at you because you're all the same." - Jonathan Davis.

  <br />
  <br />
  It's not that I am a different kind of person for the sole purpose of wanting to be different. I am different because I want to do a lot during my time alive. The people that are different are the ones we know and think of when considering the movers and shakers in society, and I am going to do everything I can to be one of those people.

</p>
<h3>
Question 3: What do you do in everyday life that's different?
</h3>
<p>

I put value in enjoying life and connecting with others, but when all is said and done, I believe I am here to leave a big impact and to do that I have to make the most out of each and every second of my life. I am constantly looking for new opportuntities, reflecting to grow as a person, and working to connect with others, because when all is said and done, and I am looking back on my life, I want to know that I did everything I possibly could have done.
<br />
<br />
So on a day-to-day basis, I avoid spending my time doing things that are of no value to me. I hardly watch television, I don't use Netflix, I never play video games (unless in a social setting, and even then typically not). I sleep less most nights than people. Because think about this. If you sleep 9 hours a night and I sleep 6, then over the course of a week I have 21 more hours in my day than you, or over the course of a year almost 1100 hours (45 days). So instead of messing around I am studying, reading, connecting with people, having memorable experiences, reflecting, and making the most out of this wonderful thing called life.

                 My Time Interning at TopOPPS</h4>

                   </h4>


                <div class = "subheading2">

                  I’m at the halfway point of my current internship with TopOPPS, so it seems fitting to reflect on the first two months of my time here. I go to Washington University, so I come downtown to the office twice each week via the metro. Despite having to take off by 8:30 each day in order to make it to the office by 10, each Tuesday and Friday morning I jump out of bed when my alarm goes off.
                  <br />
                  <br />


              I have always been interested in tech and startups, so when TopOPPS approached my student entrepreneurship group at Wash U looking for interns, I immediately sent over a resume. I was fortunate to receive a position, and have absolutely loved the experience thus far.
    <br />    <br />
              I feel as if many of my introductory business classes at school, while great, are missing the real life aspect of learning. So the chance to come into a real company and learn about business in a more experiential way has been an invaluable experience for me.
    <br />    <br />
              Each day I come in and have tasks set for me to accomplish that day. Sometimes they are related to Salesforce and going through TopOPPS’s leads, sometimes I work to find new ways to bring in leads, and other times I look at the data behind what TopOPPS has been doing to work towards more efficient lead conversions.
    <br />    <br />
              Through this process I have learned a lot about Salesforce and the way that companies, like TopOPPS (who offer improved sales forecasting and analytics), go about their day-to-day activities.
    <br />    <br />
              What I’ve also realized is that this industry of sales forecasting can be confusing. There are still parts I don’t understand, and I have been here for a few months. It can be difficult to convince other companies that this service is very valuable when they might not even understand their challenges can be fixed. Once sales leaders realize how strong and valuable the product is, they’ll have no reason not to buy in.
    <br />    <br />
              And the best part is that the strength of TopOPPS goes beyond the superior product. The people here are just as great. Everyone in the office is so upbeat, energetic and passionate about what they do. A potential company wouldn’t even need an hour in here to realize why TopOPPS software is worth buying.
    <br />    <br />
              Recapping the first half of my experience thus far, I would say that I have learned a lot about the sales forecasting industry and the sales and marketing within it. More importantly, though, I have come to love, appreciate and enjoy the company culture that TopOPPS has built. I am looking forward to the second half of my internship as I continue to learn, spend time in the office, and work to help show the world all that TopOPPS can offer.   </div>
